# Java Stdlib Impl
This repository contains custom implementations of common Java data structures and algorithms. The goal is educational, focusing on how these structures work under the hood.

### Disclaimers
1. Documentations and illustrations are assisted by AI, feel free to point out if there is any discrepancy
2. Some implementations are simplified / ignored to make the class as simple as possible (Kindly refer to the the related class for detail implementations)
